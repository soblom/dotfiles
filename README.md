# My Dotfiles

## Constraints

Configured "from the ground up":

 - "Manual" configuration of ZSH, no Frameworks such as "Oh My-ZSH" or Antigen
 - No Dotfile framework such as YADR

## Credits

Most of the ZSH configuration is based on Mark H. Nichols great article [Zsh Configuration From the Ground Up](http://zanshin.net/2013/02/02/zsh-configuration-from-the-ground-up/)

I also peaked into some dotfile repos listed on [dotfiles.github.com](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
